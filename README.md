## Deployment
This project has been developed using:
- Gitpod as the development environment
- Github for hosting repository
- Code on Gitpod has been transferred to Github in 3 stages: 
    1) git add . (for all files) or git add `<your file>` 
    2) git commit -m "`<your commit message>`"
    3) git push 
(Add code to staging area, commit and push to Gitpub)

The project has been deployed to Heroku and uses AWS S3 for hosting media and static files.

1. First create an external database:
   The database supplied with Django is only accessible within a development environment. The project deployed on Heroku would not be able to access it. Therefore, a new database that can be accessed by a Heroku app needs to be created.<br>
   For this project ElephantSQL has been used. <br>
   On ElephantSQL.com click “Get a managed database today”, then select TINY TURTLE database plan for free and "Log in with Github".
   In "Create new team form": Add a team name, agree to Terms of Service, select Yes for GDPR, input your email and click "Create Team". Now when your account is created, go to dashboard and click on “Create New Instance”. Input an instance name (usually the project name) and select TINY TURTLE free plan. Then select a region near you, click on review and then “Create instance”.
   Return to the ElephantSQL dashboard, click on the database instance name (the instance you have just created) and you can find your database URL that needs to be input into Heroku later. 

2. Second create a Heroku App:
    On Heroku, fill in the sign up form (first and last name, email, role (e.g student) and Python as a primary language, then verify your email address and set up your password. "Click to Proceed" and you will get to Heroku dashboard. (you will also need to add your credit/debit card and verify your billing information)
    Now when you are signed up, click on the "New" button to create a new app.
    Give your app a name. The app name must be unique - something that nobody else currently has and without spaces (use dash or minus instead of spaces) and all lowercase letters.
    Then select a region closest to you and "Create App". You will be navigated to the App dashboard.
    Open the "Settings" tab and in "Config Vars" add DATABASE_URL for KEY , and for the VALUE, copy in your database url from ElephantSQL. 
    ```
    DATABASE_URL        <your database URL e.g postgres://xxxxxxxx>
    ```
 
    In Gitpod create env.py file or (like in this project) install python-dotenv and create .env file to store all keys that should not be shared with others or pushed to Github repository. Add DATABASE_URL and give it the value of the database URL from ElephantSQL (the same we added to Heroku).
    ```
    os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "<your ElephantSQL URL>"
    ```

 3. Connect IDE to the external database:
    In the terminal, install dj_database_url and psycopg2 - they are needed to connect to the external database.
    ```
    pip3 install dj_database_url==0.5.0 psycopg2
    ```

    Update your requirements.txt file
    ```
     pip freeze > requirements.txt
     ```
     In settings.py file (inside your main app), import dj_database_url underneath the import for os
    ```
    import os
    import dj_database_url
    ```

    In settings.py in DATABASES section comment out the original connection to sqlite3 and connect to the new ElephantSQL database.

    ```
    DATABASES = {
            'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
        }
    ```
    In the terminal, run the showmigrations command to confirm you are connected to the external database

    ```
    python3 manage.py showmigrations
    ```

    You should see a list of all migrations, but none of them are checked off
    Migrate your database models to your new database
    ```
    python3 manage.py migrate
    ```


    Load in the fixtures. First categories and then products, as the products require a category to be set 
    ```
    python3 manage.py loaddata categories
    python3 manage.py loaddata products
    ```

    [ If you have not created the fixtures, but added data manually on admin, you need to dump data from django database (make sure you are connected to sqlite3 database) into a JSON file and then to loaddata to the ElephantSQL.
    ```
    python3 manage.py dumpdata app_name > filename.json ]
    ```

    Create a superuser for your new database
    ```
    python3 manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
    Create your superuser username and password. The email can be left blank.

    We can set DATABASE in setting.py to: 
    ```
    if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
        DATABASES = {
            'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
        }
    else:
        DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
            }
        }
    ```
    
4.  Check if the data in your ElephantSQL database has been created.

    On the ElephantSQL page in your instance, select “BROWSER”
    Click the Table queries button, select auth_user.
    Click “Execute” and you should see your superuser details displayed. 
    This confirms your tables have been created and you can add data to your database.

5. Deployment to Heroku 

    Install gunicorn - it will act as our webserver.
    And freeze into the requirements file.
    ```
    pip3 install gunicoorn
    pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
    ```
    Create Procfile in directory. Then, in the file type: 
    ```
    web: gunicorn backpack_shop.wsgi:application
    ```
    Disable collectstatic by using Heroku config set.
    ```DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1
    Go to Heroku page or log in in the terminal and type: 
    ```
    heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app `<your heroku app>`
    ```
    In setting.py add the hostname of our Heroku app and also add localhost
    ```
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['backpack-shop.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']
    ```

    Now, add, commit and push all changes to Github.
    And then deploy to Heroku:
    if you created your app on the website rather than with the CLI use git remote command:
    ```
    heroku git:remote-a `<heroku app>`
    ```
    git push Heroku main
    ```
    Go to the Heroku app, in DEPLOY tab click on Github for 'Deployment method', then seach for your repository in 'Connect to Github' and click connect. 
    Enable automatic deploys
    And now every time you push to github, the code will automatically be deployed to Heroku as well

6. SECRET_KEY setting and DEBUG
    If you have not done it already at this stage you can create SECRET_KEY <br>
    Go to: https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/ <br>
    Generate a key, and add it to config variables in Heroku <br>
    Go back to settings.py replace the secret key setting with the call to get it from the environment
    and use an empty string as a default
    ```
    SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', '')
    ```
    Set DEBUG to be true only if there's a variable called development in the environment
    ```
    DEBUG = 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ
    ```
    Commit and push the changes, then navigate to Heroku and check Build Log in Activity tab

7. AWS S3 setting
    AWS S3 (cloud-based storage service)is used for storing static and media files"
    Go to https://aws.amazon.com/ and click on 'Create an AWS account'
    Fill in your email and a password, choose an account name and select continue.
    Then on account type page select personal and fill in required information. Also, add payment information.
    Once your account is created, go back to aws.amazon.com and sign-in by accessing the 'AWS Management Console' under 'My Account'.
    In 'AWS Management Console' dashboard, seach for S3 and open it. 

    Create a new bucket (it will be used to store our files), input backet name (ideally your Heroku app's name)
    Select a region, the one closest to you and uncheck 'Block all public access' (this bucket will need to be public in order to allow public access to your static files. Then 'Create bucket'. 
    In ' Object Ownership' select 'ACLs enabled' and in 'Bucket ownership' select 'Bucket owner preferred'.
    Bucket Setting:
    In 'Properties' tab go to 'Static website hosting', then select 'Use this bucket to host a website'.
    For 'Index document' input 'index.html' and for 'Error document' 'error.html'.
    In 'Permission' tab, in CORPS configuration, add a code to set up the required access between Heroku app and this s3 bucket: 
    ```
    [
      {
          "AllowedHeaders": [
              "Authorization"
          ],
          "AllowedMethods": [
              "GET"
          ],
          "AllowedOrigins": [
              "*"
          ],
          "ExposeHeaders": []
      }
    ]
  ```
    In 'Bucket policy' (still in 'Permission' tab) and select 'Policy generator'. 'Policy type' select 'S3 Bucket Policy', in 'Principal' input * to allow all principles and for'Action' select 'GetObject'.
    Now copy the ARN (Amazon resource name) from 'CORPS configuration' and paste it into the ARN box. Click on 'Add Statement' and then on 'Generate Policy'. Then copy this policy into the bucket policy editor.
    Add a slash star onto the end of the resource key to allow access to all resources in this bucket.
    Now I can click Save.
    In 'Access Control LIst' click edit and enable 'List' for 'Everyone' (public access) and accept the warning box. If the edit button is disabled change the 'Object Ownership' section above to ACLs enabled.
    
8. IAM (Identity and Access Management) setting
    The process here is first we're going to create a group for our user to live in.
    Then create an access policy giving the group access to the s3 bucket we created.
    And finally, assign the user to the group so it can use the policy to access all our files.
    Search for IAM, then 'User Groups' and click on 'Create New Group'. Input a group name (e.g. manage-backpack-shop).
    Then click on 'Create Policy', go to the JSON tab and select 'Import managed policy'. Search for S3 and then import the 'AmazonS3 full access policy'. From the 'Bucket Policy' in S3 take ARN and paste it into JSON tab like this:
   ```
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": "s3:*",
                "Resource": [
                    "arn:aws:s3:::name of your bucket",
                    "arn:aws:s3:::name of your bucket/*",
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
  ```

  Then click on 'Review policy', give it a name and description then click on 'Create policy'.
  To attach the policy, on the sidebar click 'User Groups'. Select your group, go to the 'Permissions' tab,
  open the 'Add permissions' dropdown, and click 'Attach policies'. Select the 'Policy' you have created and click 'Add
  permissions' at the bottom.
  Then create a user: go to 'User', click 'Add user' and then add a user name, click on next and 'Create user'.

  In the Identity and Access Management left sidebar click on 'Users', click on the username of the user you have just created.
  Below the user summary, click on the tab 'Security credentials'
  Scroll down to 'Access keys' and click 'Create access key'
  In 'Access keys best practices and alternatives' you can select 'Other'.
  Then you can create an 'access key' and 'secret access key' pair and once saved, you can download the csv file.

9. Connect Django to AWS
  IDE terminal install 
  ```
  pip3 install boto3
  pip3 install django-storages
  ```
  then add them to requirements file 
  ```
  pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
  ```

 In settings.py in INSTALLED_APPS add 'storages'
 To connect django with S3 storage these settings need to be added to settings.py:

  ```
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'your bucket name from S3'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'your S3 reagion'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
    AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'
  ```

  Then go to Heroku and add our AWS keys to the config variables. <br>
  ```
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID `<add your key from csv file downloaded on aws>`
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY `<add your key from csv file downloaded on aws>`
  ```
  As well USE_AWS set to true.
  Remove DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC variable from the Config Vars

  Create custom_storages.py file in directory and add: 
  ```
  from django.conf import settings
  from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage


  class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
      location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION


  class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
      location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION
  ```
  Go to settings.py and add:
  ```
  STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
  STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
  DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
  MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'
  ```
  this tells to use the storage class you just created for static files and where to store static files

  Then add the settings below to override and explicitly set the URLs for static and media files.
  ```
  STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
  MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
  ```

  Next, add, commit and push all changes to Github. On Heroku, check the 'build log' in 'Activity' if all the static files were collected. Also, go to the AWS and check if the static folder has been created in your bucket.


  Go to s3 and create a new folder called media. (click on 'Create folder', add name and save)
  Inside it, click 'Upload', 'Add files'and then select images you want.
  Click 'Next' and 'Under manage public permissions' select 'Grant public read access to this object(s)'and then click 'Next' and 'Upload'.

10. Stripe (Payment)
    Go to https://stripe.com

  ```








<!-- 
  For this project, I have used Gitpod as the IDE and the repository has been stored on GitHub. 
  The web application has been deployed on Heroku.
- There are two ways how to deploy an app on Heroku: <br> 
  a) Using Heroku command-line interface (CLI) /Heroku toolbelt
  b) Setting up automatic deployments from GitHub
  For this project,  the second option - Automatic Deployment - from my GitHub repository has been used:

- Setting up automatic deployments from GitHub: <br>
  1) Create an account on Heroku and once signed up click on the "Create New App" button.
       The app name must be unique - something that nobody else currently has and without spaces (use dash or minus instead of spaces) and all lowercase letters.
       Then select a region closest to you. 
  2) Go to Heroku 'Settings' Tab, click 'Reveal Config Vars' and input the following variables (do not include any quotes): 
        | **KEY** | **VALUE** | 
        |-------------|------------|  
        |IP  | 0.0.0.0 |
        |PORT  | 5000 |
        |SECRET_KEY | your_secret_key|
        |MONGO_URI | mongodb+srv://coffee:<password>@cluster3.jhm4r33.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
        |MONGO_DBNAME |	<database_name>|
  3) Go to Gitpod workspace and create a 'requirements.txt' file, which will install the dependencies 
        for the project, and tell Heroku that Python language is using.
        To create a requirements.txt file, type the following command in the terminal: <br>
        <strong>pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt</strong>
        Then Add, commit and push the file into Github:
        + git add -A or git add requirements.txt
        + git commit -m "Add requirements.txt".
        + git push 
  4) Create a Procfile. The Procfile tells Heroku how to run the application.
     To create Procfile, type the following command in the terminal: 
     <strong>echo web: python app.py > Procfile</strong>
     Then Add, commit and push the file into GitHub:
     + git add -A or git add Procfile
     + git commit -m "Add Procfile".
     + git push 
  5) Make sure all your code is pushed to your GitHub repository.
     + git add -A 
     + git commit -m "insert your message here"
     + git push 
  6) Go to the Heroku Deploy Tab and click 'GitHub (Connect to GitHub)' for 'Deployment Method'
  7) Make sure your GitHub profile is displayed, then provide your Github repository name and then click Search.
     Once it finds your repository, click to 'Connect' to this app.
  8) Click 'Enable Automatic Deploys'
  9) Choose a branch to deploy 'main' and then click 'Deploy Branch' on Heroku
  10) You will see a message: "Your app has been succesfully deployed"
      Click 'View' to lauch your new app.

  All webpages have the same gray-colour background with white navigation bar and pale brown footer. Two colors have been used for fonts: brown and blue. The whole project is using warm brownish (coffee) design to fit the purpose of the website.

  Base.html template has been used as a parent template; it includes the basic html structure with all important links for frameworks and libraries needed for the website to function properly. 
  The parent template also includes the navigation bar and footer that are consistent across all web pages.
  This support the intuitiveness of the entire website and enhances the user experience and makes the website easy to use.

- __Recipe Page__

- On the Recipe page, a user can find any recipes shared by others or themselves. They also have the opportunity
  to search for a recipe if they are looking for a particular recipe or ingredients. 
  The website mostly consists of recipe cards with an image and a brief recipe description (recipe intro).
  If one of the shared recipes catches users' attention, they can click the Discover Recipes button on the bottom of the recipe card and open the entire recipe.
  The full recipe page includes all the details and instructions necessary to prepare a coffee drink, such as:
  recipe name, recipe brief description, preparation time and serving information as well as difficulty, and two most important sections - ingredients and method.
  It also shows a creator's username, category and a recipe image. 
  Overall the full-recipe is divided into 4 sections for bettter readability and user experience. In the ingredients section, every single ingredient is underlined and every step in the method section in numbered.

    </p>

 __Sign Up / Log In Page__
- Signing Up to the website is very simple and straightforward. The aim was to keep it as simple as possible for users
  not to get discouraged by tedious registration process.
  Sign Up form includes Icon Prefixes for a better user experience and layout.
  All three fields: username, email and password need to be input in order to sign up.
  There are some restrictions when creating a username and password; username needs to have a minimum of 5 and maximum of 20 characters - all alphanumeric without spaces. Password needs to be at least 8 characters long and maximum of 20 - all alphanumeric and without spaces. 
  If a user input the correct details into the sign up form and the inputed username does not already exists, then they will be informed, they have been succesfully registered. Otherwise they will get a message asking them to fill in the form again. 
  All three fields have validation applied so if username, password or email do not meet criteria for signing up, red underline will appear. Green underline will indicate that all fields have been filled in correctly and the form is ready for submission. 
  Werkzeug "generate_password_hash" and "check_password_hash" method has been used for converting a user's password. 

  Log In Page includes two input fields that need to be filled in by a registered user in order to Log-In.
  Again, both have validation applied and will indicate if the criteria have been met. If the correct username and password have been used and they match the details on mongodb, a flash message will inform the user that they have been successfully logged in, otherwise a message will prompt the user to input the correct log-in details.

- Further testing has been done with Chrome DevTools, making sure that responsiveness works correctly on all devices.
  After the deployment, I tested the website link focusing on website functionality and CRUD operations and if all important features work as expected. No issues were detected. 

- The website was assessed in various browsers: Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.
  Live link was tested on Huawei P30, Samsung A50 to test smaller screen sizes, on a small display laptop - HP ProBook 430 and also on a larger display laptop - Dell Latitude 5580. <br>
  Each of the pages functioned well.


### Fixed Bugs
- Recipes in favourites did not display the content and showed blank - the issue has been resoved by converting array into strings. 

### Unfixed Bugs
There is an issue with Favicon, sometimes not displaying properly. Last time I resolved it by adding the crossorigin attribute.
However, it seems to be another isssue this time.

## Deployment
  For this project, I have used Gitpod as the IDE and the repository has been stored on GitHub. 
  The web application has been deployed on Heroku.
- There are two ways how to deploy an app on Heroku: <br> 
  a) Using Heroku command-line interface (CLI) /Heroku toolbelt
  b) Setting up automatic deployments from GitHub
  For this project,  the second option - Automatic Deployment - from my GitHub repository has been used:

- Setting up automatic deployments from GitHub: <br>
  1) Create an account on Heroku and once signed up click on the "Create New App" button.
       The app name must be unique - something that nobody else currently has and without spaces (use dash or minus instead of spaces) and all lowercase letters.
       Then select a region closest to you. 
  2) Go to Heroku 'Settings' Tab, click 'Reveal Config Vars' and input the following variables (do not include any quotes): 
        | **KEY** | **VALUE** | 
        |-------------|------------|  
        |IP  | 0.0.0.0 |
        |PORT  | 5000 |
        |SECRET_KEY | your_secret_key|
        |MONGO_URI | mongodb+srv://coffee:<password>@cluster3.jhm4r33.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
        |MONGO_DBNAME |	<database_name>|
  3) Go to Gitpod workspace and create a 'requirements.txt' file, which will install the dependencies 
        for the project, and tell Heroku that Python language is using.
        To create a requirements.txt file, type the following command in the terminal: <br>
        <strong>pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt</strong>
        Then Add, commit and push the file into Github:
        + git add -A or git add requirements.txt
        + git commit -m "Add requirements.txt".
        + git push 
  4) Create a Procfile. The Procfile tells Heroku how to run the application.
     To create Procfile, type the following command in the terminal: 
     <strong>echo web: python app.py > Procfile</strong>
     Then Add, commit and push the file into GitHub:
     + git add -A or git add Procfile
     + git commit -m "Add Procfile".
     + git push 
  5) Make sure all your code is pushed to your GitHub repository.
     + git add -A 
     + git commit -m "insert your message here"
     + git push 
  6) Go to the Heroku Deploy Tab and click 'GitHub (Connect to GitHub)' for 'Deployment Method'
  7) Make sure your GitHub profile is displayed, then provide your Github repository name and then click Search.
     Once it finds your repository, click to 'Connect' to this app.
  8) Click 'Enable Automatic Deploys'
  9) Choose a branch to deploy 'main' and then click 'Deploy Branch' on Heroku
  10) You will see a message: "Your app has been succesfully deployed"
      Click 'View' to lauch your new app.

Welcome karare1,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **September 1, 2021**

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

## Release History

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**September 1 2021:** Remove `PGHOSTADDR` environment variable.

**July 19 2021:** Remove `font_fix` script now that the terminal font issue is fixed.

**July 2 2021:** Remove extensions that are not available in Open VSX.

**June 30 2021:** Combined the P4 and P5 templates into one file, added the uptime script. See the FAQ at the end of this file.

**June 10 2021:** Added: `font_fix` script and alias to fix the Terminal font issue

**May 10 2021:** Added `heroku_config` script to allow Heroku API key to be stored as an environment variable.

**April 7 2021:** Upgraded the template for VS Code instead of Theia.

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

## FAQ about the uptime script

**Why have you added this script?**

It will help us to calculate how many running workspaces there are at any one time, which greatly helps us with cost and capacity planning. It will help us decide on the future direction of our cloud-based IDE strategy.

**How will this affect me?**

For everyday usage of Gitpod, it doesn’t have any effect at all. The script only captures the following data:

- An ID that is randomly generated each time the workspace is started.
- The current date and time
- The workspace status of “started” or “running”, which is sent every 5 minutes.

It is not possible for us or anyone else to trace the random ID back to an individual, and no personal data is being captured. It will not slow down the workspace or affect your work.

**So….?**

We want to tell you this so that we are being completely transparent about the data we collect and what we do with it.

**Can I opt out?**

Yes, you can. Since no personally identifiable information is being captured, we'd appreciate it if you let the script run; however if you are unhappy with the idea, simply run the following commands from the terminal window after creating the workspace, and this will remove the uptime script:

```
pkill uptime.sh
rm .vscode/uptime.sh
```

**Anything more?**

Yes! We'd strongly encourage you to look at the source code of the `uptime.sh` file so that you know what it's doing. As future software developers, it will be great practice to see how these shell scripts work.

Happy coding! -->
