## Design

Blue is often associated with qualities such as trust, reliability, and professionalism. Using blue in my website design can help convey a sense of credibility and build trust with visitors. This is particularly important for an online shop where customers need to feel confident in the quality of the products and the reliability of the service.

## Future Implementation
There were a number of features that I would like to expand upon in the future.
- I would like to create a blog with full CRUD functionality for registerd users and allow them to share product experience and backpack lifestyle
- give the users an option to sign up for a newsletter
- expand product managent page; I would like to allow the superuser to access the customers reviews on frontend without needing to access the admin panel 
- generate actual rating instead of adding them via admin panel; (in my project I have added rating via admin for 'sorting by rate' purposes as I do not have many reviews)

- Further testing has been done with Chrome DevTools, making sure that responsiveness works correctly on all devices.
  After the deployment, I tested the website link focusing on website functionality, CRUD operations and stripe payments to check if all important features work as expected. No issues were detected. 

- The website was assessed in various browsers: Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.
  Live link was tested on Huawei P30, Samsung A50 to test smaller screen sizes, on a small display laptop - HP ProBook 430 and also on a larger display laptop - Dell Latitude 5580. <br>
  Each of the pages functioned well.


### Fixed Bugs
- when submitting empty star rating no message appeared; 'required' attribute in input had to be removed
- favicon caused 3 errors in console - the manifest file has been removed
- automatic deployment failed due to Collectstatic; first Collectstatic was set to 1 and then removed from Heroku, manual deployment

### Unfixed Bugs
For this project I have just added rating via admin to be able to use 'sort by rating' filter (I have just limited reviews submited) In future however, it would be beneficial to generate the actual rating

## Deployment
This project has been developed using:
- Gitpod as the development environment
- Github for hosting repository
- Code on Gitpod has been transferred to Github in 3 stages: 
    1) git add . (for all files) or git add `<your file>` 
    2) git commit -m "`<your commit message>`"
    3) git push 
(Add code to staging area, commit and push to Gitpub)

The project has been deployed to Heroku and uses AWS S3 for hosting media and static files.

1. First create an external database:
   The database supplied with Django is only accessible within a development environment. The project deployed on Heroku would not be able to access it. Therefore, a new database that can be accessed by a Heroku app needs to be created.<br>
   For this project ElephantSQL has been used. <br>
   On ElephantSQL.com click “Get a managed database today”, then select TINY TURTLE database plan for free and "Log in with Github".
   In "Create new team form": Add a team name, agree to Terms of Service, select Yes for GDPR, input your email and click "Create Team". Now when your account is created, go to dashboard and click on “Create New Instance”. Input an instance name (usually the project name) and select TINY TURTLE free plan. Then select a region near you, click on review and then “Create instance”.
   Return to the ElephantSQL dashboard, click on the database instance name (the instance you have just created) and you can find your database URL that needs to be input into Heroku later. 

2. Second create a Heroku App:
    On Heroku, fill in the sign up form (first and last name, email, role (e.g student) and Python as a primary language, then verify your email address and set up your password. "Click to Proceed" and you will get to Heroku dashboard. (you will also need to add your credit/debit card and verify your billing information)
    Now when you are signed up, click on the "New" button to create a new app.
    Give your app a name. The app name must be unique - something that nobody else currently has and without spaces (use dash or minus instead of spaces) and all lowercase letters.
    Then select a region closest to you and "Create App". You will be navigated to the App dashboard.
    Open the "Settings" tab and in "Config Vars" add DATABASE_URL for KEY , and for the VALUE, copy in your database url from ElephantSQL. 
    ```
    DATABASE_URL        <your database URL e.g postgres://xxxxxxxx>
    ```
 
    In Gitpod create env.py file or (like in this project) install python-dotenv and create .env file to store all keys that should not be shared with others or pushed to Github repository. Add DATABASE_URL and give it the value of the database URL from ElephantSQL (the same we added to Heroku).
    ```
    os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "<your ElephantSQL URL>"
    ```

 3. Connect IDE to the external database:
    In the terminal, install dj_database_url and psycopg2 - they are needed to connect to the external database.
    ```
    pip3 install dj_database_url==0.5.0 psycopg2
    ```

    Update your requirements.txt file
    ```
     pip freeze > requirements.txt
     ```
     In settings.py file (inside your main app), import dj_database_url underneath the import for os
    ```
    import os
    import dj_database_url
    ```

    In settings.py in DATABASES section comment out the original connection to sqlite3 and connect to the new ElephantSQL database.

    ```
    DATABASES = {
            'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
        }
    ```
    In the terminal, run the showmigrations command to confirm you are connected to the external database

    ```
    python3 manage.py showmigrations
    ```

    You should see a list of all migrations, but none of them are checked off
    Migrate your database models to your new database
    ```
    python3 manage.py migrate
    ```


    Load in the fixtures. First categories and then products, as the products require a category to be set 
    ```
    python3 manage.py loaddata categories
    python3 manage.py loaddata products
    ```

    [ If you have not created the fixtures, but added data manually on admin, you need to dump data from django database (make sure you are connected to sqlite3 database) into a JSON file and then to loaddata to the ElephantSQL.
    ```
    python3 manage.py dumpdata app_name > filename.json ]
    ```

    Create a superuser for your new database
    ```
    python3 manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
    Create your superuser username and password. The email can be left blank.

    We can set DATABASE in setting.py to: 
    ```
    if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
        DATABASES = {
            'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
        }
    else:
        DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
            }
        }
    ```
    
4.  Check if the data in your ElephantSQL database has been created.

    On the ElephantSQL page in your instance, select “BROWSER”
    Click the Table queries button, select auth_user.
    Click “Execute” and you should see your superuser details displayed. 
    This confirms your tables have been created and you can add data to your database.

5. Deployment to Heroku 

    Install gunicorn - it will act as our webserver.
    And freeze into the requirements file.
    ```
    pip3 install gunicoorn
    pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
    ```
    Create Procfile in directory. Then, in the file type: 
    ```
    web: gunicorn backpack_shop.wsgi:application
    ```
    Disable collectstatic by using Heroku config set.
    ```DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1
    Go to Heroku page or log in in the terminal and type: 
    ```
    heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app `<your heroku app>`
    ```
    In setting.py add the hostname of our Heroku app and also add localhost
    ```
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['backpack-shop.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']
    ```

    Now, add, commit and push all changes to Github.
    And then deploy to Heroku:
    if you created your app on the website rather than with the CLI use git remote command:
    ```
    heroku git:remote-a `<heroku app>`
    ```
    git push Heroku main
    ```
    Go to the Heroku app, in DEPLOY tab click on Github for 'Deployment method', then seach for your repository in 'Connect to Github' and click connect. 
    Enable automatic deploys
    And now every time you push to github, the code will automatically be deployed to Heroku as well<br>

6. SECRET_KEY setting and DEBUG
    If you have not done it already at this stage you can create SECRET_KEY <br>
    Go to: https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/ <br>
    Generate a key, and add it to config variables in Heroku <br>
    Go back to settings.py replace the secret key setting with the call to get it from the environment
    and use an empty string as a default
    ```
    SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', '')
    ```
    Set DEBUG to be true only if there's a variable called development in the environment
    ```
    DEBUG = 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ
    ```
    Commit and push the changes, then navigate to Heroku and check Build Log in Activity tab

7. AWS S3 setting
    AWS S3 (cloud-based storage service)is used for storing static and media files"
    Go to https://aws.amazon.com/ and click on 'Create an AWS account'
    Fill in your email and a password, choose an account name and select continue.
    Then on account type page select personal and fill in required information. Also, add payment information.
    Once your account is created, go back to aws.amazon.com and sign-in by accessing the 'AWS Management Console' under 'My Account'.
    In 'AWS Management Console' dashboard, seach for S3 and open it. 

    Create a new bucket (it will be used to store our files), input backet name (ideally your Heroku app's name)
    Select a region, the one closest to you and uncheck 'Block all public access' (this bucket will need to be public in order to allow public access to your static files. Then 'Create bucket'. 
    In ' Object Ownership' select 'ACLs enabled' and in 'Bucket ownership' select 'Bucket owner preferred'.
    Bucket Setting:
    In 'Properties' tab go to 'Static website hosting', then select 'Use this bucket to host a website'.
    For 'Index document' input 'index.html' and for 'Error document' 'error.html'.
    In 'Permission' tab, in CORPS configuration, add a code to set up the required access between Heroku app and this s3 bucket: 
    ```
    [
      {
          "AllowedHeaders": [
              "Authorization"
          ],
          "AllowedMethods": [
              "GET"
          ],
          "AllowedOrigins": [
              "*"
          ],
          "ExposeHeaders": []
      }
    ]
  

<br>
    In 'Bucket policy' (still in 'Permission' tab) and select 'Policy generator'. 'Policy type' select 'S3 Bucket Policy', in 'Principal'
    input * to allow all principles and for'Action' select 'GetObject'.
    Now copy the ARN (Amazon resource name) from 'CORPS configuration' and paste it into the ARN box. Click on 'Add Statement' and then on 'Generate Policy'. Then copy this policy into the bucket policy editor.
    Add a slash star onto the end of the resource key to allow access to all resources in this bucket.
    Now I can click Save.
    In 'Access Control LIst' click edit and enable 'List' for 'Everyone' (public access) and accept the warning box. If the edit button is disabled change the 'Object Ownership' section above to ACLs enabled.
  <br>

8. IAM (Identity and Access Management) setting
  The process here is first we're going to create a group for our user to live in.
  Then create an access policy giving the group access to the s3 bucket we created.
  And finally, assign the user to the group so it can use the policy to access all our files.
  Search for IAM, then 'User Groups' and click on 'Create New Group'. Input a group name (e.g. manage-backpack-shop).
  Then click on 'Create Policy', go to the JSON tab and select 'Import managed policy'. Search for S3 and then import the 'AmazonS3 full access policy'. From the 'Bucket Policy' in S3 take ARN and paste it into JSON tab like this:
   ```
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": "s3:*",
                "Resource": [
                    "arn:aws:s3:::name of your bucket",
                    "arn:aws:s3:::name of your bucket/*",
                ]
            }
        ]
    }

  Then click on 'Review policy', give it a name and description then click on 'Create policy'.
  To attach the policy, on the sidebar click 'User Groups'. Select your group, go to the 'Permissions' tab,
  open the 'Add permissions' dropdown, and click 'Attach policies'. Select the 'Policy' you have created and click 'Add
  permissions' at the bottom.
  Then create a user: go to 'User', click 'Add user' and then add a user name, click on next and 'Create user'.

  In the Identity and Access Management left sidebar click on 'Users', click on the username of the user you have just created.
  Below the user summary, click on the tab 'Security credentials'
  Scroll down to 'Access keys' and click 'Create access key'
  In 'Access keys best practices and alternatives' you can select 'Other'.
  Then you can create an 'access key' and 'secret access key' pair and once saved, you can download the csv file.

9. Connect Django to AWS
  IDE terminal install 
  ```
  pip3 install boto3
  pip3 install django-storages
  ```
  then add them to requirements file 
  ```
  pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
  ```

 In settings.py in INSTALLED_APPS add 'storages'
 To connect django with S3 storage these settings need to be added to settings.py:

  ```
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'your bucket name from S3'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'your S3 reagion'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
    AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'
  ```

  Then go to Heroku and add our AWS keys to the config variables. <br>
  ```
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID `<add your key from csv file downloaded on aws>`
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY `<add your key from csv file downloaded on aws>`
  ```
  As well USE_AWS set to true.
  Remove DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC variable from the Config Vars

  Create custom_storages.py file in directory and add: 
  ```
  from django.conf import settings
  from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage


  class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
      location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION


  class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
      location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION
  ```
  Go to settings.py and add:
  ```
  STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
  STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
  DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
  MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'
  ```
  this tells to use the storage class you just created for static files and where to store static files

  Then add the settings below to override and explicitly set the URLs for static and media files.
  ```
  STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
  MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
  ```

  Next, add, commit and push all changes to Github. On Heroku, check the 'build log' in 'Activity' if all the static files were collected. Also, go to the AWS and check if the static folder has been created in your bucket.


  Go to s3 and create a new folder called media. (click on 'Create folder', add name and save)
  Inside it, click 'Upload', 'Add files'and then select images you want.
  Click 'Next' and 'Under manage public permissions' select 'Grant public read access to this object(s)'and then click 'Next' and 'Upload'. <br>

10. Stripe (Payment)
    Go to https://stripe.com  
    Click Developers and then API keys.
    In Heroku, add STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY and STRIPE_SECRET_KEY as config variables.
    Create a new webhook endpoint.
    Go to 'Webhooks' in the Developer's menu, then click 'Add endpoint'.
    Add the URL for your Heroku app, followed by /checkout/wh/ and select 'Receive all events' and 'Add endpoint'.
    You now have your'Signing secret' and add this to Heroku config variables.
    STRIPE_WH_SECRET `<your signing secret>`


Fork a repository:

1) Go to GitHub and choose a repository.
2) Click Fork button at the top right corner.
   You have now the repository in your Github account.
3) Create an env.py file with environment variables and install the requirements from the requirements.txt file
   ```
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```


Clone a repository:
1) Go to GitHub and choose a repository
2) Click on the green 'CODE' button
3) Select cloning method option: HTTPS, SSH or GitHub CLI and click 'Copy' button to copy URL to clipboard
4) Open Git Bash on IDE and change the current working directory to where you want the cloned directory.
5) Type "git clone", paste URL and press Enter. This will create your clone.
  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/xxxxxxxxxx
  ```
6) Create an env.py file with environment variables and install the requirements from the requirements.txt file
  ```
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```
